However, the language of the original text can be challenging for modern readers, especially for those who are not familiar with Italian. That's why Piero Chiara, a renowned 20th-century writer and translator, decided to "translate" the medieval language into a more accessible and contemporary one, without losing the charm and flavor of Boccaccio's style. He selected 10 stories from the Decamerone and retold them in his own words, preserving the plot, the characters, and the atmosphere of each tale.
  
The result is a delightful book that can be enjoyed by anyone who wants to discover or rediscover the beauty and wisdom of Boccaccio's masterpiece. The book is available in PDF format online, and it includes audio files that allow you to listen to the stories as well as read them.

In this article, we will give you a brief overview of each story and explain why they are still relevant and captivating today.
  
## Frate Cipolla e la penna dell'Arcangelo Gabriele (Brother Onion and the Feather of Archangel Gabriel)
  
This story is a hilarious example of how a clever and witty friar manages to deceive a gullible crowd of peasants with a fake relic: a feather that supposedly belonged to Archangel Gabriel. He uses his rhetorical skills and his knowledge of human psychology to persuade them that the feather has miraculous powers and that they can benefit from them if they donate money to his order. However, his plan is almost ruined by two pranksters who steal his feather and replace it with a coal. How will he get out of this tricky situation?
  
This story shows how Boccaccio mocks the corruption and hypocrisy of some religious figures who exploit the faith and ignorance of the people for their own gain. It also illustrates how humor can be a powerful weapon against deception and oppression.

## Torello e il Saladino (Torello and Saladin)
  
This story is a touching example of how kindness and generosity can overcome cultural and religious differences. It tells the story of Torello, a nobleman from Pavia who is famous for his hospitality and his lavish lifestyle. He hosts a group of Saracen merchants who are actually disguised spies sent by Saladin, the sultan of Egypt and Syria. Saladin is impressed by Torello's generosity and decides to invite him to his court. However, Torello's wife thinks he is dead after he fails to return from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. She decides to remarry after a year of mourning. Torello learns about this from an angel who transports him back to Italy in one night. He arrives just in time to stop the wedding and reunite with his wife.
  
This story shows how Boccaccio celebrates the values of hospitality, friendship, loyalty, and forgiveness. It also shows how he portrays different cultures and religions with respect and curiosity, highlighting their similarities rather than their differences.

## Pietro e l'Agnolella (Pietro and Agnolella)
  
This story is a thrilling example of how love can overcome adversity and danger. It tells the story of Pietro, a young man from Certaldo who falls in love with Agnolella, the daughter of a peasant. They elope together but they encounter many perils along their way:
