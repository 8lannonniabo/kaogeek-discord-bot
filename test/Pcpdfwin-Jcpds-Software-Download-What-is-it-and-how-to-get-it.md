# Pcpdfwin Jcpds Software Download: What is it and how to get it?
 
Pcpdfwin is a software that allows users to search and view the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) database, which contains information on the crystal structures and diffraction patterns of various materials. The PDF database is maintained by the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD), formerly known as the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS).

Pcpdfwin is an old software that runs only on Windows 7 32-bit operating system[^1^]. It is not available for download from the official website of ICDD, which offers other software products such as PDF-4+, PDF-2, and PDF-4/Organics. Users who want to access the PDF database need to purchase a license from ICDD or use other free or paid alternatives.
 
## Free alternatives to Pcpdfwin
 
Some of the free alternatives to Pcpdfwin are:
 
- **COD (Crystallography Open Database)**: COD is an open-access database that contains over one million crystal structures of organic, inorganic, and metal-organic compounds. Users can download CIF files and use software such as Mercury to plot structure models and save reflection lists and XRD calculated patterns[^2^].
- **The American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database**: This database contains every structure published in the American Mineralogist, The Canadian Mineralogist, European Journal of Mineralogy and Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, as well as selected datasets from other journals. Users can search by mineral name, chemical formula, space group, cell parameters, and other criteria[^3^].
- **DASH**: DASH is a software package for solving crystal structures from powder diffraction data. DASH uses simulated annealing of structural models to indexed diffraction data and features a wizard to guide users through the structure solution process.

## Paid alternatives to Pcpdfwin
 
Some of the paid alternatives to Pcpdfwin are:

- **HighScore Plus**: HighScore Plus is a software package for phase identification, crystallographic analysis, and Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data. HighScore Plus can access the PDF-4+ database as well as other databases such as COD and ICSD.
- **TOPAS**: TOPAS is a software package for general profile and structure analysis of powder diffraction data. TOPAS can perform Rietveld refinement, Le Bail fitting, Pawley fitting, pattern decomposition, and other methods. TOPAS can also access the PDF-4+ database as well as other databases such as COD and ICSD.
